I am a first-year Data Science Master's student at UC San Diego. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I focus primarily on multi-sensor fusion for foundation models, language-driven representation learning, self-supervised learning, and physiological signal analysis.

**Projects**

### Foundation Model on Physiological Signals
**Ongoing Project**  
Developing a foundation model with self-supervised learning for analyzing and interpreting multivariate physiological signals.

### VitT: Vision-Topological Transformer for Medical Image Classification
**Spring 2024**  
Introducing the VitT model, which incorporates task-specific topological features into a pre-trained ViT using a lightweight persistent diagram encoder and fusion layer, resulting in better performance than vanilla ViT linear probing with minimal computational cost.

### An Empirical Study of Image Style Transfer
**Spring 2024**  
Conducting a comprehensive empirical study on various techniques for image style transfer. The project aims to evaluate the performance and efficiency of different style transfer methods.

### E-StyTR^2: Efficient Image Style Transfer with Transformers
**Spring 2024**  
Optimizing the StyTr^2 framework for image style transfer by reducing computational demands with minimal performance tradeoffs, and an integrated ablation study examines the impact of various components to enhance overall efficiency and effectiveness.

### Image-to-Image Retrieval with CLIP
**Winter 2024**  
Implementing an image-to-image retrieval system using CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining) encode, suggesting that CLIP can capture more robust representations than traditional ResNet.

### Navigating the Landscape of Explanation Multiplicity
**Fall 2023**  
This literature review examines the challenges and strategies associated with explanation multiplicity in machine learning models. The project aims to highlight the implications of having multiple explanations for model decisions and to develop effective methods for managing them.

### An Empirical Study on Optimizers Selection
**Fall 2023**  
Conducting an empirical study to analyze the selection of optimizers, including SGD, RMSProp, ADAM, and BFGS, in machine learning. The project aims to offer insights and guidelines for choosing the most effective optimizer for various models and datasets under different real-world constraints.
