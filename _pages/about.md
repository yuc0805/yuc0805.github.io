I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Dartmouth College, advised by [Prof. Andrew Campbell](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/). Previously, I completed my M.S. in Data Science at the University of California, San Diego, where I worked with [Prof. Jingjing Zou](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/jingjing.zou) and [Prof. Tauhidur Rahman](https://www.tauhidurrahman.com/). 

I am interested in using large language models, multimodal models, and agent systems for health data analysis. My focus is on developing methods that enable these models to handle continuous and noisy wearable sensor streams to infer health outcomes.
