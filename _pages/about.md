I am a first-year Data Science Master's student at UC San Diego. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I focus primarily on multi-sensor fusion for foundation models, language-driven representation learning, self-supervised learning, and physiological signal analysis.
